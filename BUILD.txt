This was developed on Windows, though it should compile
and run on linux just as well.


REQUIRED COMPONENTS ON WINDOWS
- caml from http://caml.inria.fr/ (developed on v3.11)
- flexdll from http://alain.frisch.fr/flexdll.html
- bzip2 source code from http://www.bzip.org/ (if building the BinaryDB flavor)
- MS VC++ 2008 from http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/ (2005 works, too)
- MS Platform SDK 2003 R2 from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx
	(use whatever SDK version is appropriate for your machine)

In the following:
	- "<toolset>" refers to the directory in which the toolset has been unzipped
	- "<sdk>" refers to the directory in which the MS Platform SDK has been installed

COMPONENT LOCATIONS
- caml native-code compiler requires flexdll.
  After installing caml, copy the following into the caml "bin" directory
  from the flexdll zip file:
	flexdll_inter_msvc.obj, flexdll_msvc.obj, flexlink.exe, default.manifest

- copy *.h & *.c from the bzip2 source code distribution into
  the <toolset>/camlbz2 subdirectory

- caml compiler doesn't like spaces in directory names, thus a number of
  files need to be copied or relocated to different directories.
	- mkdir <toolset>\camlbz2\include
	- copy *.h into <toolset>\camlbz2\include from <sdk>\include

	- mkdir <toolset>\libs
	- copy the following files into <toolset>\libs from <sdk>\lib:
		advapi32.lib, ws2_32.lib, uuid.lib

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
cd <toolset>
setenv.bat

COMPILE COMPRESSION LIBRARY (only needed for BinaryDB flavor)
cd <toolset>\camlbz2
mkdir Release
compile.bat
del include (these files are no longer needed)

COMPILE BINARYDB FLAVOR
cd <toolset>
mkdir Release
compile.bat

COMPILE DIRECT FLAVOR
cd <toolset>\dbfdirect
mkdir Release
compile.bat
